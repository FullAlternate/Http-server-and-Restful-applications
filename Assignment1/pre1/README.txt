README for testing implementation of Inf-2301 Assignment 1

To test the implementation of part A:

 - Copy the contents of the folder PartA into your server directory.
 - Start your web server on localhost port 8080.
 - Open a browser at http://localhost:8080/ .
 - If the page seems to work, your GET implementation works. 
   Beware that you need to perform GET requests for more than just "/" for your POST implementation to work.
 - To test POST fill in the form and submit.
 - If you see the text you submitted in the following page, your POST should work fine.

To test the implementation of part B:

 - Start your server on localhost port 8080.
 - Use programs like Postman to issue RESTful requests to your WebAPI


If you find any errors or get stuck, please contact the teaching assistants.
